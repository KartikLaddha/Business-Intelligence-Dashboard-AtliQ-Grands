# Business-Intelligence-Dashboard-AtliQ-Grands

## üìå Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making. In response, the company decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence to gain insights from historical data and improve strategic planning. As a data analyst, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard using Power BI based on stakeholder requirements and sample data.
